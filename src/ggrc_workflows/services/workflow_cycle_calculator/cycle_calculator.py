  """Cycle calculation for all workflow frequencies with the exception of
  one-time workflows.

  Cycle calculator is an abstract class that implements all the operations
  needed by workflows, namely task_date_range, workflow_date_range and
  next_cycle_start_date.

  Each implementation of a class has to implement it's own
  relative_day_to_date method that calculates the real date based on
  the base_date provided to the method and taking into account the specifics
  of the frequency. relative_day_to_date SHOULD NOT adjust dates but
  should only convert them to datetime.date objects.

  Attributes:
    date_domain: Class implementation's domain in which values passed to it are
                 to be found
    time_delta: Class implementation's atomic unit by which addition/subtraction
                will take place during calculations.
    HOLIDAYS: Official holidays with the addition of several days that Google
              observes. See file google_holidays.py for details.
